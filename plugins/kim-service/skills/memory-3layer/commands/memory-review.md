# Memory Review

Read the writable root (`MEMORY_DIR` or `<repo>/.memory-3layer/`) and, when it
exists, the legacy `<repo>/.claude/memory/` only when `MEMORY_LEGACY_READ=1` was explicitly enabled.

1. Validate every `items.json`; report invalid files without rewriting them.
2. Find exact duplicates after whitespace/case normalization.
3. Identify high-frequency, recent-trend, decay, and potential-conflict patterns.
4. Propose Layer 3 promotions only when evidence is traceable.
5. Ask for confirmation before changing `status` or `MEMORY.md`.

Permanent repository rules may belong in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or another
runtime-native instruction file. Do not assume Claude Code is the only host.
Never promote model inference, secrets, raw transcripts, or full tool output.
